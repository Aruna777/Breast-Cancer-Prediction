# Breast-Cancer-Prediction
This project focuses on predicting breast cancer diagnosis using machine learning techniques on the Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset. The dataset includes features computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. The goal is to develop an accurate and reliable predictive model to assist in the early detection of breast cancer.

Features
1. Utilized the Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset for training and evaluation of the model.
2. Implemented machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classification, and Random Forest Classification.
3. Provided insights into feature importance and model performance metrics.
4. This project aims to contribute to early detection efforts and enhance medical decision-making in breast cancer diagnosis.

Dependencies
1. Python
2. NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib.
